Long ago, in the last dying light of the planet earth, we escaped to the stars. There, humanity flourished. A great and vast empire formed, thousands of solar systems, spanning the entire Galaxy. Science and Culture flourished, and Humanity pushed further & further. It was here that a system of intersteller highways was created, allowing ease of travel to other planets. Humanity ruled it's empire from a new, terra-formed earth, now known as the "Solium Tellus et Stellas." Like all great mpires however, it could not last. 

People grew weary of the power it's Capital commanded, and each solar system developed further apart in culture and ideals. Eventualy, a series of revolutions and uprisings occured, and the Galaxy was consumed by war. The Great War, as it is now refered to, ravaged the Galaxy, countless civilisations fell, and in the end, so too did the Empire. The highways between worlds destroyed, those planets that survived became isolated from each other, and as contact was lost between each other, a dark age fell.

After that, the colonies barely survived, alone in the vastness of space. Without any connection to each other, each one became more and more unique, untill one could no longer determine if they were at anypoint, the same people.

Now, a renaissance has occured, the old earth ideals of exploration and travel are resurging, and the Colonies are beging to make contact and trade with one another. The Galaxy seems to have a bright future ahead of it, but no one can know what the future holds.
